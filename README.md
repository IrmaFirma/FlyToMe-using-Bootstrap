# FlyToMe-using-Bootstrap
FlyToMe – Bootstrap Practice Project
A responsive travel-themed landing page built as a hands-on practice exercise using Bootstrap 4. The project explores core front-end concepts such as layout design, Flexbox and Grid integration, image carousels, responsive navigation bars, and custom component styling.

Project Purpose:
This project was created as part of my journey to strengthen front-end web development skills using Bootstrap. FlyToMe is a fictional travel agency brand designed to simulate a real-world design scenario. The aim was to apply Bootstrap’s utility classes, components, and layout system to build an elegant and functional web interface.
